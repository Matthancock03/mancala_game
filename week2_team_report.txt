 << 2nd Team Weekly Report>>

 Monday, 11/01 ~  10/07 
 Team Name: NFG (Non-Functional Group)
 Team leader of the week: Thien Van
 Team members: Matthew Hancock, Thien Van, and Anthony Vo
 
 Summary (written by the team leader) 
For this week, more work was done on implementing the board view and controllers.
A new tester class is used to extend testing for the GUI functionality.
There is an issue about getting the correct coordinates with the mouselistener;
with each pit represented as a panel, each panel when clicked on, returns
the relative x and y coordinates, and makes it difficult to assign a panel.
Future suggestions for resolution is to either rework the view to use a single 
panel, or to redo the panel.
